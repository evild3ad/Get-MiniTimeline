      3222601751: The name of an attribute in an identity is not within the legal range
      3222601752: An identity contains two definitions for the same attribute
      3222601753: The identity string is malformed. This may be due to a trailing comma, more than two unnamed attributes, a missing attribute name, or a missing attribute value
      3222601754: The component store has become corrupted
      3222601755: A component's file does not match the verification information present in the component manifest

      3222863875: The requested operation was made in the context of a transaction that is no longer active
      3222863876: The transaction manager was unable to be successfully initialized. Transacted operations are not supported
      3222863877: Transaction support within the specified file system resource manager was not started or was shut down due to an error
      3222863878: The metadata of the resource manager has been corrupted. The resource manager will not function
      3222863879: The resource manager attempted to prepare a transaction that it has not successfully joined

      3222863882: The remote server or share does not support transacted file operations
      3222863883: The requested log size for the file system resource manager is invalid
      3222863884: The remote server sent mismatching version number or Fid for a file opened with transactions
      3222863887: The resource manager tried to register a protocol that already exists
      3222863888: The attempt to propagate the transaction failed
      3222863889: The requested propagation protocol was not registered as a CRM
      3222863890: The transaction object already has a superior enlistment, and the caller attempted an operation that would have created a new superior. Only a single superior enlistment is allowed
      3222863891: The requested operation is not valid on the transaction object in its current state
      3222863892: The caller has called a response API, but the response is not expected because the transaction manager did not issue the corresponding request to the caller
      3222863893: It is too late to perform the requested operation, because the transaction has already been aborted
      3222863894: It is too late to perform the requested operation, because the transaction has already been committed
      3222863895: The buffer passed in to NtPushTransaction or NtPullTransaction is not in a valid format
      3222863896: The current transaction context associated with the thread is not a valid handle to a transaction object
      3222863897: An attempt to create space in the transactional resource manager's log failed. The failure status has been recorded in the event log
      3222863905: The object (file, stream, or link) that corresponds to the handle has been deleted by a transaction savepoint rollback
      3222863906: The specified file miniversion was not found for this transacted file open
      3222863907: The specified file miniversion was found but has been invalidated. The most likely cause is a transaction savepoint rollback
      3222863908: A miniversion may be opened only in the context of the transaction that created it
      3222863909: It is not possible to open a miniversion with modify access
      3222863910: It is not possible to create any more miniversions for this stream
      3222863912: The handle has been invalidated by a transaction. The most likely cause is the presence of memory mapping on a file or an open handle when the transaction ended or rolled back to savepoint
      3222863920: The log data is corrupt
      3222863922: The transaction outcome is unavailable because the resource manager responsible for it is disconnected
      3222863923: The request was rejected because the enlistment in question is not a superior enlistment
      3222863926: The file cannot be opened in a transaction because its identity depends on the outcome of an unresolved transaction
      3222863927: The operation cannot be performed because another transaction is depending on this property not changing
      3222863928: The operation would involve a single file with two transactional resource managers and is, therefore, not allowed
      3222863929: The $Txf directory must be empty for this operation to succeed
      3222863930: The operation would leave a transactional resource manager in an inconsistent state and is therefore not allowed
      3222863931: The operation could not be completed because the transaction manager does not have a log
      3222863932: A rollback could not be scheduled because a previously scheduled rollback has already executed or been queued for execution
      3222863933: The transactional metadata attribute on the file or directory is corrupt and unreadable
      3222863934: The encryption operation could not be completed because a transaction is active
      3222863935: This object is not allowed to be opened in a transaction
      3222863936: Memory mapping (creating a mapped section) a remote file under a transaction is not supported
      3222863939: Promotion was required to allow the resource manager to enlist, but the transaction was set to disallow it
      3222863940: This file is open for modification in an unresolved transaction and may be opened for execute only by a transacted reader
      3222863941: The request to thaw frozen transactions was ignored because transactions were not previously frozen
      3222863942: Transactions cannot be frozen because a freeze is already in progress
      3222863943: The target volume is not a snapshot volume. This operation is valid only on a volume mounted as a snapshot
      3222863944: The savepoint operation failed because files are open on the transaction, which is not permitted
      3222863945: The sparse operation could not be completed because a transaction is active on the file
      3222863946: The call to create a transaction manager object failed because the Tm Identity that is stored in the log file does not match the Tm Identity that was passed in as an argument
      3222863947: I/O was attempted on a section object that has been floated as a result of a transaction ending. There is no valid data
      3222863948: The transactional resource manager cannot currently accept transacted work due to a transient condition, such as low resources

      3222863956: The call to create a superior enlistment on this transaction object could not be completed because the transaction object specified for the enlistment is a subordinate branch of the transaction. Only the root of the transaction can be enlisted as a superior
      3222863957: Because the associated transaction manager or resource manager has been closed, the handle is no longer valid
      3222863958: The compression operation could not be completed because a transaction is active on the file
      3222863959: The specified operation could not be performed on this superior enlistment because the enlistment was not created with the corresponding completion response in the NotificationMask
      3222863960: The specified operation could not be performed because the record to be logged was too long. This can occur because either there are too many enlistments on this transaction or the combined RecoveryInformation being logged on behalf of those enlistments is too long
      3222863961: The link-tracking operation could not be completed because a transaction is active
      3222863962: This operation cannot be performed in a transaction
      3222863963: The kernel transaction manager had to abort or forget the transaction because it blocked forward progress
      3222863968: The handle is no longer properly associated with its transaction.  It may have been opened in a transactional resource manager that was subsequently forced to restart.  Please close the handle and open a new one
      3222863969: The specified operation could not be performed because the resource manager is not enlisted in the transaction

      3222929441: Log archival is in progress
      3222929442: The operation requires a nonephemeral log, but the log is ephemeral
      3222929443: The log must have at least two containers before it can be read from or written to
      3222929444: A log client has already registered on the stream
